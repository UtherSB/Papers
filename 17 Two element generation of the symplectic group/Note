There are so many statements of this theorem that there is a sense in which you can leave it.

It is totally believable that for a homogeneous systems LARC is a nec and sufficient condition. If this needs proving formally then come back.

It is more controversial that the set of generators are dense in LxL. However this isn't necessarily so helpful. Amazing and MArco doesn't believe it but finding it may not be worth the effort.

This compact drift field sounds interesting. That result may be elsewhere. HERE.

This single input case seems to be contained in ElAssoudi2014 nicely. This is something that you have been holding off for a while.

All of this is leaving out the idea of bounds on the function parameters. This will be something to come back to. COME BACK TO.
